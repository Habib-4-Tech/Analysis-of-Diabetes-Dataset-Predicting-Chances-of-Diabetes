# **Diabetes Data Analysis and Prediction**

This project analyzes and predicts diabetes outcomes using a combination of **statistical analysis** and **machine learning models**. It includes a full workflow — from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and clinical interpretation.

---

## **Project Overview**

The notebook demonstrates how data-driven techniques can be used to identify key risk factors for diabetes and predict disease likelihood with high reliability.
It integrates both **statistical tests** (T-Test, Chi-Square, ANOVA) and **ML algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).

## **How to Run the Project**

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload the provided **CSV dataset** (`diabetes.csv` or similar) to your Colab session.
3. Run each code block **sequentially from top to bottom**.
4. Review outputs including data visualizations, statistical results, and model performance metrics.

## **Key Features**

* Comprehensive **data preprocessing** (encoding, scaling, feature engineering)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
* Statistical validation of key predictors
* Training and evaluation of multiple **ML classifiers**
* Model performance comparison with accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics
* Clinically interpretable insights into diabetes risk factors

## **Requirements**

The notebook automatically installs necessary dependencies in Colab.
If running locally, ensure you have:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy
```

## **Dataset**

The dataset includes demographic and clinical variables such as age, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, hypertension, and smoking history.
It is used to explore relationships between patient features and diabetes outcomes.
